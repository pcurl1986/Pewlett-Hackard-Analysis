# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a Database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and also to prepare a mentorship initiative.
